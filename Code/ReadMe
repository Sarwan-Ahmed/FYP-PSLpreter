We have collected our own dataset, then we converted it into frames, applied data augmentation, 
Removed background, converted into NumPy arrays, Normalize the pixel values, then divided it into
train, validation and test sets. 
The given colab files are related to each other so it is possible that running a single file in isolated
form will not work.
